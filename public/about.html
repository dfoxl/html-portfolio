<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
   Hi, I'm Diana. I'm an aspiring web developer currently learning HTML and front-end web development. 
   I enjoy building simple, clean websites and gradually improving them as I learn new skills. 
</p>

<p>
    I'm currently working through hands-on projects like multi-page websites and personal portfolios, 
    focusing on writing well-structured code and understanding how the web works. 
    I enjoy learning by building and experimenting with real projects.

<p>
    I plan to continue growing my web development skills and eventually create polished, user-friendly websites. 
    I'm excited to keep learning, improving, and sharing my work as I progress on my web development journey.
